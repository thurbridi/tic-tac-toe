# Tic-Tac-Toe

This implementation is intended to be played on terminal and has an AI opponent that uses minimax algorithm to search for the best available move to make.

It's still a little rough on the edges, so here is a list I plan to add:
- alpha-beta prunning
- game modes (AI vs. AI | human vs. AI | human vs. human)
- game menu (for mode selection and player symbol selection)
